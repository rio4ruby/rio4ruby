= Rio - Ruby I/O Facilitator

fa-cil-i-tate:  To make easy or easier 

Rio is a facade for most of the standard ruby classes that deal with
I/O; providing a simple, intuitive, succinct interface to the
functionality provided by IO, File, Dir, Pathname, FileUtils,
Tempfile, StringIO, OpenURI and others. Rio also provides an
application level interface which allows many common I/O idioms to be
expressed succinctly.
