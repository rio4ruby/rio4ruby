# ==== Rio - Ruby I/O Facilitator
#
# Rio is a facade for most of the standard ruby classes that deal with
# I/O; providing a simple, intuitive, succinct interface to the
# functionality provided by IO, File, Dir, Pathname, FileUtils,
# Tempfile, StringIO, OpenURI and others. Rio also provides an
# application level interface which allows many common I/O idioms to be
# expressed succinctly.
