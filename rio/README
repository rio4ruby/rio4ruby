IO, File, Dir, Pathname, FileUtils, Tempfile, StringIO, OpenURI, Zlib, and CSV.

To create the documentation for Rio run the command
  rake rdoc
from the distribution directory. 

If your don't have rake installed try:
  ruby RUNME.1st.rb
from  the distribution directory.

Then point your browser at the 'doc/rdoc' directory.

* RIO::Doc::INTRO
* RIO::Doc::HOWTO
* RIO::Rio

To install Rio untar the distribution and type
  rake install

If you don't have rake installed, get it.

Until you do, you may want to try
  ruby setup.rb

To build the documentation without rake, try
 rdoc --op doc/rdoc -m RIO::Doc::SYNOPSIS README lib/rio/doc/*.rb lib/rio.rb lib/rio/if/*.rb lib/rio/kernel.rb
 
Then point your browser at doc/rdoc.

* lib/rio/doc/HOWTO.rb
* lib/rio/if/*.rb
