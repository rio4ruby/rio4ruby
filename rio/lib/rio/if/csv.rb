module RIO
  class Rio
    #def file() target.file end

    # Puts a Rio in CSV mode and sets the field and record separators.
    # In csv mode selecting with Rio#records will cause each line
    # read to be parsed into a line with the CSV standard library.
    # Specifying using Rio#lines to select will return unparsed strings
    # as normal.
    #
    #  # copy a csv file, changing the field separator
    #  rio('afile.csv').csv > rio('afile_semicolons.csv').csv(';')
    #
    # CSV mode also adds two methods Rio#columns and Rio#nocolumns which 
    # allows selecting columns by column index using Fixnums or Ranges
    # in a way similar to how lines are selected.
    #
    #  # iterate through every line but only get the first three columns
    #  rio("afile.csv").csv.columns(0..2) { |array_of_fields| ... }
    #
    #  # iterate through every line but skip the columns 2 and 3 through 5
    #  rio("afile.csv").csv.nocolumns(2,3..5) { |array_of_fields| ... }
    #
    #  # an array containg all but the first line returning columns 5,6 and 7
    #  rio("afile.csv").csv.columns(5..7).skiplines[0]
    #
    # See RIO::Doc::INTRO for complete documentation on csv mode.
