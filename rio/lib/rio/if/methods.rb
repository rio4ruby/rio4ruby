    # Sets the rio to read lines and returns the Rio

    # If called with a block behaves as if lines(*args).each(&block) had been called

    # +lines+ returns the Rio which called it. This might seem counter-intuitive at first. 
    # One might reasonably assume that
    #  rio('adir').lines(0..10)
    # would return lines. It does not. It configures the rio to return lines and returns
    # the Rio. This enables chaining for further configuration so constructs like
    #  rio('afile').lines(0..10).skiplines(/::/)
    # are possible.

    # Proc::    a proc which will be called for each record, records are included unless nil or false is returned
    # Symbol::  a symbol which will _sent_ to each record, records are included unless nil or false is returned
    # Array::   an array of other selectors. records are selected unless any of the matches fail.

    # a +read+ on a directory it knows to use Dir#open and call Dir#read. When it encounters a Rio#puts, it knows
    # to perform a File#open, and call IO#puts on the returned handle. By default when a method requires
    # a file be opened for writing the file is opened with a mode of 'w'. Rio#a changes this implicit 
    # output mode to 'a'.

    # it sees an operator that requires writing, and must determine for itself how to open it.

    #
    # ==== The Exception
    #
    # When a block is passed directly to the rio constructor +closeoncopy+ is turned off.
    #
    #  rio('afile') { |file|
    #    file.closeoncopy? #=> false
    #    file < a_string
    #    file.closed?  #=> false
    #  }
    #  # The file is now closed. See Rio#rio for more informatioin
    # 
    # ==== Why?
    #
    # Some of my favorite Rio idioms are its copy one-liners
    #
    #  rio('afile') < a_string # put a string into a file
    #  rio('afile') < an_array # put an array into a file
    #  rio('afile') < rio('anotherfile').lines(1..10) # copy the first 10 lines of anotherfile into afile
    #  rio('afile.gz').gzip < rio('anotherfile').lines(1..10) # same thing into a gzipped file
    #
    # In each of these cases, 'afile' would remain open after the copy and furthermore
    # since the destination Rio was not saved in a variable, There is no way to close file.
    # Without closeoncopy Something like this would be required:
    #
    #  ario = rio('afile')
    #  ario < something_else
    #  ario.close
    #
    # Or this...
    #
    #  ario = rio('afile') < something_else
    #  ario.close
    #
    # Or this...
    #
    #  (rio('afile') < something_else).close
    # One line, but ugly, and prone to error.
    #
    # What I want is this:
    #
    #  rio('afile') < something_else
    #
    # Simple. I want to copy this to that, I point the arrow and it works.
    #
    # In perl the rio's destructor would be called, because there are no remaining references to the Rio
    # However, it my understanding and experience that in Ruby the finalizer will not necessarily be 
    # called at this point. Calling all gurus: If I am missing something, 
    # and there is a way to make this work without closeoncopy,
    # please contact the author.
